        <h4>rpi 2 bitcoin full node</h4>
        <p>by mjl, mon, jan 25, 2015</p>
        <p>So, I admit, I was a bit late in the game regarding Bitcoin. Or more
than a little actually. Sure, I&rsquo;ve read a bit about it, but I never
really got into it. Until a few months ago, when I had lunch with a
former colleague who is very much into Bitcoin. We met up for lunch at
<a href="https://epicenterstockholm.com/">Epicenter</a>. I had a sandwich,
minderal water, and I tried out the first Bitcoin
<a href="http://coinatmradar.com/bitcoin_atm/434/bitcoin-atm-bitaccess-stockholm-btcx-office/">ATM</a>
in Stockholm. Since then I have been spending a lot of time reading up
on Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve decided I must try to setup my own full Bitcoin node. It
seems like good fun, and also the adult, responsible thing to do.</p>

<p>I wanted to go pretty minimal, while still being reasonably simple to
setup. So I opted for a Raspberry Pi 2 with
<a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/broadcom/raspberry-pi-2">Arch</a>.</p>

<p>As I started out, I thought that I would be able to make the world a
wonderful service by documenting my endeavor. Turns out I only had to
follow the instructions for installing
<a href="http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/broadcom/raspberry-pi-2">Arch</a>,
installing bitcoind and bitcoin-cli from packages, and then following
the instructions at <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node">bitcoin.org</a>
for setting up a full node (granted, I should probably have built from
source myself, to be on the safe side). It&rsquo;s not the fastest node in
the network, but hey, it&rsquo;s cheap and simple, and thus far looks like a
great way to get started.</p>

<p>I have not yet opened up my node for incoming traffic, as I am waiting
for the blockchain to synchronize.</p>
