        <h3>about</h3>
        

<p>My name is <a href="https://se.linkedin.com/in/liseborn">Johan Liseborn</a> and I
have been working with software development since 1989, when I joined
Ericsson in Bollmora. After a few years of developing PBXes in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLEX_(programming_language)">Plex-M</a>
I went to study computer science in
<a href="https://www.liu.se/utbildning/pabyggnad/6MICS?l=en">Link√∂ping</a>. During
that time, the internet became a thing, and since then, most of what I
have been working on has been internet related.</p>

<p>In 1999 I co-founded Hotsip, where we built voice, video, and chat
applications and infrastructure based on
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt">SIP</a>. Hotsip got acquired by
Oracle in 2006, and I spent a few years there. After that I co-founded
a company offering mobile based task management for small businesses,
but that never took off. I spent a few years working in the financial
industry, first with TriOptima, and then briefly with Klarna.</p>

<p>In 2010 I joined Glactic to work on a web based dating service
including real-time voice and video speed dating. The system was
pretty cool, including a real-time matching engine based on Solr, and
a real-time voice and video exchange engine built in Erlang, but once
again, the service never took off.</p>

<p>In late 2011 I became employee #1 and CTO at Magine TV, where I was
part of designing and building, from the ground, a real-time
transcoding and streaming system for live, linear TV. I left Magine at
the beginning of 2015, to found Castlerock and work on new, exciting
projects.</p>

<p>Through the years I have learned that I like startups, and I like to
be part of solving new problems and creating new systems from scratch.</p>

<p>Through the years, I have been working with many different things,
from being a junior programmer to being a manager, a CTO, a board
member, and a chairman of the board. I have found that what I like
most is to work in startups, with a bright team, solving new problems,
and building systems from scratch.</p>

<h5 id="my-history-in-computing:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47">my history in computing</h5>

<p>I started out learning programming on my own in the early 80s. The
first computer I used was a friends
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81">ZX81</a>. I then got a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20">VIC-20</a>, followed by
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">C64</a>. I started out
programming in Basic on the ZX81 and the two Commodore machines. I
also started learning 6502 assembler on the VIC-20.</p>

<p>In &lsquo;84 or &lsquo;85 I got a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL">Sinclair QL</a>, which was a
really cool machine. It had a basic interpreter that was really easy,
to extend with your own commands (in assembler), and it had a 68008
CPU, which meant I could start playing around with 68k assembly. It
also had a pretty neat storage system, consisting of two &ldquo;microdrives&rdquo;
with infinite loop tape cartridges. The only thing that sucked was the
graphics, so it was no-good for gaming.</p>

<p>In &lsquo;86 or &lsquo;87 I got an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST">Atari 1040ST</a>, and a few
years later I had a brief stint with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST#Atari_TT">Atari TT</a>. Sometime
in the mid 80s, I don&rsquo;t remember exactly when, I read an interview
with Richard M. Stallman in a Swedish computer magazine. This was my
first real exposure to free software. I found out that there was quite
a lot of free software available for the Atari, and I started
downloading and playing with all kinds of different free software
packages, including Lisp and Scheme.</p>

<p>Sometime during &lsquo;89 or &lsquo;90 I got my first Sun workstation at work
(this was at Ericsson; before that it had all been IBM mainframes at
work), and I started learning Unix.</p>

<p>I got my first regular PC, a 486, sometime in the early 90s, probably
in &lsquo;92. I ran windows for a while, I tried OS/2 (it was handed out for
free at my university and it was completely useless on that machine),
and then switched to GNU/Linux, probably late &lsquo;92 or early &lsquo;93.</p>

<p>In December &lsquo;99 I got hold of <a href="http://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> 2.6 and
fell in love with the OS and the approach of the project. The focus,
the attention to detail, and the dedication to the project goals, as
well as the somewhat brusk, no-nonse and to-the-point way of
communication (that some people perceive as rude) are all things I
appreciate. For a few years, I ran OpenBSD as my primary operating
system, on a number of IBM ThinkPads.</p>

<p>Since the mid 90s I have had a whole bunch of machines, mostly
laptops, and mostly IBM ThinkPads (and later Lenovos). I switched to
Apple machines (I know, I know) sometime in the mid 00s, the first one
was a 12&rdquo; PowerBook. I have always been fond of small laptops,
favoring portability rather than raw performance. This also goes well
with my thought that most software is bloated, and that we in general
should be able to get by with smaller, cheaper machines.</p>

<p>I have been pretty happy with OS X for many years, but I am not too
fond of its non-freeness, and it&rsquo;s increasing focus on locking the
users in and seducing them into buying stuff, so recently I have
started to switch over to run GNU/Linux on most of my lingering Apple
machines. Currently, my main laptop is a mid-2012 MacBook Air running
<a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint 17.2 Rafaela Cinnamon Edition</a>. The
use of GNU/Linux is mostly out of laciness, and my current goal is to
switch back to using OpenBSD as my main operating system.</p>
