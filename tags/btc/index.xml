      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I admit, I was a bit late in the game regarding Bitcoin. Or more
than a little actually. Sure, I&amp;rsquo;ve read a bit about it, but I never
really got into it. Until a few months ago, when I had lunch with a
former colleague who is very much into Bitcoin. We met up for lunch at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://epicenterstockholm.com/&#34;&gt;Epicenter&lt;/a&gt;. I had a sandwich,
minderal water, and I tried out the first Bitcoin
&lt;a href=&#34;http://coinatmradar.com/bitcoin_atm/434/bitcoin-atm-bitaccess-stockholm-btcx-office/&#34;&gt;ATM&lt;/a&gt;
in Stockholm. Since then I have been spending a lot of time reading up
on Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I must try to setup my own full Bitcoin node. It
seems like good fun, and also the adult, responsible thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to go pretty minimal, while still being reasonably simple to
setup. So I opted for a Raspberry Pi 2 with
&lt;a href=&#34;http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/broadcom/raspberry-pi-2&#34;&gt;Arch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started out, I thought that I would be able to make the world a
wonderful service by documenting my endeavor. Turns out I only had to
follow the instructions for installing
&lt;a href=&#34;http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/broadcom/raspberry-pi-2&#34;&gt;Arch&lt;/a&gt;,
installing bitcoind and bitcoin-cli from packages, and then following
the instructions at &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node&#34;&gt;bitcoin.org&lt;/a&gt;
for setting up a full node (granted, I should probably have built from
source myself, to be on the safe side). It&amp;rsquo;s not the fastest node in
the network, but hey, it&amp;rsquo;s cheap and simple, and thus far looks like a
great way to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not yet opened up my node for incoming traffic, as I am waiting
for the blockchain to synchronize.&lt;/p&gt;
